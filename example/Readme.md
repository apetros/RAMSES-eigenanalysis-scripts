# Procedure

This procedure assumes you have pyramses (pyramses.paristidou.info) installed.

1. Load the python file simply_load_and_run.ipynb and execute the cell. This will load the data and extract the Jacobian in the form of 4 files ("jac_val.dat","jac_eqs.dat","jac_var.dat","jac_struc.dat").
2. Load MATLAB in the folder and run ssa("jac_val.dat","jac_eqs.dat","jac_var.dat","jac_struc.dat"). You will get the eigenvalues and their plot.
3. Use the interactive commands to get more information.

## Comments

- The command to extract the Jacobian works only if you use synchronous reference frame in the settings ($OMEGA_REF SYN ;).
- The dynamic Jacobian is created automatically in the workspace.
- You can limit the eigenvalues you see by giving more arguments to the ssa script. See ssa.m for documentation.
- This only works for small systems. In large ones (e.e., more than 50k states), you would need to run the ARNOLDI method in the ssa.m which is currently commented out.
